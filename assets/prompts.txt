Help :

	The scalia tool allows you to pick automatically random
	combinations of predefined sequences, such as combinations
	of pitch quality or scales, hence its interest for scale 
	practise.

	The following commands are available :
	  - help (show help)
	  - add (add sequence)
	  - current (showw added sequences)
	  - remove [n] (remove sequence of given index)
	  - save (save a sequence)
	  - forget [name] (remove from saved sequenxes)
	  - saved (display saved sequences)
	  - start (start game)
	  - exit (exit game)

	There are several gamemodes : 
	  - arcade : combinations are being picked indefinitely
	  untill you end the game.
	  - complete : the game ends when the combinations have all
	  appeared.
	  - reps : the game ends after a number of reps defined by
	  the user.

	Starting the game : 
	  - the user can add sequences by typing the command add
	  followed by a sequence separated by whitespaces.
	  - the user can remove sequences by typing the command
	  remove followed by the ID of the sequence.
	  - the user can check out added sequences by typing the
	  command checkout.
